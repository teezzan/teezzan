### Hi there 👋, I am Taiwo.
I am a Backend Developer, Cloud Engineer and Hardware Developer. I love Open-source, Electronics and starting projects. When I am not busy coding, recording a podcast or trying to create a better digital Art generating model, I usually watch anime, read books or "relax" on twitter.


- 🔭 I have a [blog on hashnode](https://taiwodevlab.hashnode.dev/) where I write my thoughts from time to time. You don't want to miss out on those.

- ⚡ I have a Podcast Called [Taiwo's Lab](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8yYjRkNDkzNC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==) where I discuss how young ones can get into tech. Check it out.

- 🔭 I am an active member of [VirtualCoffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/). An inclusive and intimate community for all devs. We do fun stuff.
 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love AI generated Art. Check it out on [Telegram](https://t.me/AiPaint_bot). Seriously, Check it out.
